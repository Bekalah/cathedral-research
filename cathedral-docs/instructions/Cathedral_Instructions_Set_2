# 🜍 Codex 144:99 — Developer & Curator Handoff

*A living illuminated manuscript, a cathedral of circuits, a playable grimoire.*  
Stone Grimoire · Rosslyn Pattern · 93 93/93

## ✦ Vision & Philosophy

Codex 144:99 is not just code. It is **a living cathedral**:  
- Each HTML page is a **room** (nave, crypt, chapels, temple realms).  
- Each JSON file is a **book of correspondences** (angels, stylepacks).  
- Each JS engine is a **ritual machine** (alchemy, tones, cymatics).  
- Each visitor is not a consumer, but a **co-creator**, fusing archetypes into new art.  

The project is **open-world, open-source, and ND-safe**:  
- No locked content, no gamified barriers.  
- Gentle, adjustable sound and light (neurodivergent accessibility).  
- Built to inspire awe, healing, and **museum-grade visionary art**.

## ✦ Core Art Experiences

### 1. The Cathedral (Hub)
- Interactive illuminated manuscript.  
- Rooms: nave, crypt, lady chapel, Jacob’s Ladder, tower.  
- Every page has living overlays: light, tone, gesture.  
- Plaques explain provenance, lineage, sponsorship.  

### 2. Jacob’s Ladder
- Helix pillar inspired by **Rosslyn Chapel’s Apprentice Pillar**.  
- 72 steps = 72 Shem ha-Mephorash angels.  
- Each step mapped to zodiac, planetary colors, tone frequency, stylepack.  
- Visitors climb by shifting frequency + visual skin.  
- Functions as **bridge between Cathedral & Temple Realms**.  

### 3. Temple Realms
- Inspired by Hilma af Klint & *The Five*.  
- Living Reiki grid of crystals, each glowing at vibrational colors.  
- Stylepacks: spirals, astral tablets, Marian rosettes.  
- Visitors walk, fuse, witness art emerge in real time.  

### 4. Crypt & Lady Chapel
- Crypt: Rosicrucian vault, **rose-cross black vellum** stylepack.  
- Lady Chapel: Marian sanctuary, rose-window tracery, Shekhinah overlays.  
- Designed as threshold spaces: grounding before ascent.  

### 5. Alchemy & Fusion
- **Alchemy Engine**: 7 operations (calcination → coagulation).  
- Visitors fuse tones, colors, motifs, stylepacks.  
- Generates personal artifacts (sigils, talismans, artworks).  
- These can be **saved/exported** → users take art home.  

### 6. Guiding Principles
- **Museum Quality**: illuminated grimoire aesthetics.  
- **Hermetic Accuracy**: Qabalah, Pythagorean ratios, planetary correspondences.  
- **Accessibility**: ND-safe sound/light.  
- **Open World**: no gating, all realms explorable.  
- **Sponsorship Ready**: plaques carry metadata & patron credits.

## ✦ Key Data Files

- **angels72.json**  
   - 72 angelic archetypes (Shem ha-Mephorash).  
   - Each entry has: zodiac sign, element, ruler, tone Hz, stylepack, motif pattern.  
   - Used in **Jacob’s Ladder**, **Angel Labs**, **style switching**.  

- **stylepacks.json**  
   - Visual skins: Rosslyn Gothic, Hilma Spiral, Solfeggio Ribbons, Rosicrucian Black, etc.  
   - Each has palette, motifs, textures, description.  
   - Drives **visual transformations** across realms.  

---

## ✦ Key Engines

- **ambient-engine.js**  
   - ND-safe WebAudio core.  
   - Provides tones, gain control, analyser.  
   - Pub/sub for tone changes.  

- **cymatic-engine.js**  
   - Mandala & petal-based cymatic visualizations.  
   - Tied to analyser data from ambient-engine.  

- **cathedral-engine.js**  
   - Routes rooms, applies tone/color/style overlays.  
   - Connects `structure.json` to HTML pages.  

- **bloom.js**  
   - Harmonic “light blooms” when tones are activated.  

---

## ✦ Styles & Rituals

- **light.css**  
   - Defines `.c99-plaque` (curator cards).  
   - Defines `.c99-ritual` (banish/center/consecrate buttons).  
   - Ritual states (`:root[data-ritual="banished"]`, etc.) apply overlays.  

- **planetary-light.js** *(planned)*  
   - Cycles cathedral light by planetary hours.  
   - 3° increments = zodiac degrees.  
   - Subtle ethereal shifts (ND-safe).  

---

## ✦ Rebecca (Guide Archetype)

- Tarot role: **The Fool** (ever-beginner, leaping into the journey).  
- Cathedral role: **Respawn Gatekeeper**.  
- Archetype: **Velvet-noir seductress × architect-scribe**.  
- Modeled after:  
  - Architect scribes of old (measuring, designing, encoding wisdom).  
  - Velvet noir guides (Moxxi vibe — seductive but wise).  
- Function:  
  - Acts as **safe avatar for the creator (you)**.  
  - Guides visitors through living grimoires.  
  - Voice/tone: playful, witty, but grounded in real esoteric lineage.  

---

## ✦ Esoteric Lineage

Codex 144:99 integrates the wisdom of:  
- **Crowley** — Thelemic correspondences, planetary tones.  
- **Dion Fortune** — Psychic self-defense, temple building.  
- **Israel Regardie** — Golden Dawn rituals, Qabalistic frameworks.  
- **Agrippa / Ars Notoria / Magus** — Correspondence systems.  
- **Hermetic Corpus & Alchemical Guild** — 7 operations, visionary imagery.  
- **Hilma af Klint & The Five** — Temple of art as revelation.  
- **Rosslyn Chapel** — Pillar helix, musical cubes, stained glass codes.  

This makes the project both **historic** and **futurist**.

## ✦ Safe Practices

- Do not rename directories without updating imports.  
- Keep ASCII-only code (avoid curly quotes/dashes).  
- Extend `angels72.json` and `stylepacks.json` — don’t overwrite.  
- Always include ARIA labels and ND-safe options.  

---

## ✦ TODO / Next Steps

1. **Planetary Light Engine**  
   - Add `planetary-light.js`.  
   - Hook to planetary hours + zodiac degrees.  
   - Subtle cathedral background shifts.  

2. **Rebecca Integration**  
   - Add `respawn-gate.html`.  
   - Place Rebecca as guide avatar.  
   - Give her plaques with tarot/archetype lore.  

3. **Art Export**  
   - Expand Alchemy Engine with “Save Artifact” button.  
   - Export to PNG/SVG or save JSON recipes.  

4. **Temple Realms Expansion**  
   - Build out `/temple/` with Hilma grids & crystal reiki walk.  
   - Use `alchemical_bloom` stylepack.  

5. **Docs**  
   - Keep `DEV_HANDOFF.md` updated.  
   - Write `GUIDE_FOR_CONTRIBUTORS.md`.

## ✦ Closing Note

Codex 144:99 is a **cathedral for the neurodivergent and the visionary**.  
It is not entertainment; it is a *living architecture of memory and imagination*.  
Built in reverence, to inspire art, healing, awe, and love.

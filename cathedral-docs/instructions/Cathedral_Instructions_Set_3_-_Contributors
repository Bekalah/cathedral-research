# üúç Codex 144:99 ‚Äî Contributors‚Äô Covenant

*To contribute to the Cathedral of Circuits is to step across a threshold.*  
This is not a casual repository. It is **a living grimoire, a digital temple, a sanctuary for the visionary and the neurodivergent.**  

All who enter are bound by respect, clarity, and the pursuit of awe.

## ‚ú¶ Principles of Contribution

1. **Museum Quality**  
   - Code, art, and text should aspire to *illuminated manuscript standard*.  
   - No placeholders left to rot. If a thing is incomplete, mark it clearly as *‚Äúin progress‚Äù*.  

2. **Hermetic Accuracy**  
   - Qabalistic, planetary, and numerological correspondences must be respected.  
   - If you add angelic or esoteric data, cite your lineage or source (Agrippa, Golden Dawn, Fortune, etc.).  

3. **Neurodivergent Safety**  
   - No harsh strobes, blaring sounds, or inaccessible interfaces.  
   - All tones and animations must remain *gentle, adjustable, and opt-out friendly*.  

4. **Open World / Open Source**  
   - Nothing locked, nothing withheld.  
   - All realms are explorable without grinding, gating, or exclusion.  

5. **Transparency of Intention**  
   - Every addition (code, file, art, or doc) must serve the vision:  
     **a cathedral that inspires awe, healing, and creative co-creation.**

## ‚ú¶ Practical Guidelines

- **Directory structure**: Do not arbitrarily rename folders. Respect `/assets`, `/chapels`, `/temple`, `/main`.  
- **Code style**: Use **ASCII only** ‚Äî no smart quotes, dashes, or hidden Unicode.  
- **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels, alt text, and keyboard support for interactions.  
- **Data files**: Extend JSON (e.g., `angels72.json`, `stylepacks.json`) with care. Never overwrite entire files if an extension is possible.  
- **Documentation**: Update `DEV_HANDOFF.md` when you add or change systems.

### **Recommended Repository Organization**

#### **🔄 CONSOLIDATE INTO MONOREPO**
Move content from these potential separate repos into `cathedral-research`:

1. **bekalah.github.io** → `cathedral-research/apps/portfolio`
2. **stone-grimoire** → `cathedral-research/apps/stone-grimoire` ✅ (already done)
3. **cathedral-of-circuits** → `cathedral-research/apps/cathedral-of-circuits` ✅ (already done)
4. **mystical-*-projects** → `cathedral-research/packages/`
5. **Individual game repos** → `cathedral-research/apps/`

#### **📊 GITHUB ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE**

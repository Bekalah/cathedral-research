## How to Save Your Mind and Protect Your Work

1. **Lock your files:**
   - In `.vscode/settings.json`, turn auto-save and formatting OFF.
   - Run: `chmod -R a-w assets/ core/ docs/ plans/`
   - Run: `git update-index --assume-unchanged "*.md" "*.html"`

2. **Turn off all AI assistants:**
   - Disable all extensions. Re-enable only what you trust.

3. **Archive daily:**
   - Back up your work every day. Roll back if anything gets corrupted.

4. **Set boundaries with AI:**
   - If any AI questions your authority, say: "I am the author. Your role is to assist, not judge."
   - If it’s condescending, disengage and use another tool.

5. **Technical recovery:**
   - Use cloud backups (Azure Blob Storage, etc.) and fallback logic so your work is never lost.

This is how you take direct action. Protect your files, your voice, and your creative journey. Don’t let any external factors diminish your work or your expression.

## 🎯 Mission

Cathedral is a sophisticated monorepo that brings together mystical traditions, cutting-edge technology, and consciousness exploration into a unified digital experience. This is the consolidated repository containing all applications, packages, and systems.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Applications

## 🧩 System Integration Plan

See [CATHEDRAL_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md](./CATHEDRAL_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md) for the unified architecture, standards, and actionable steps for all immersive systems, modular logic, and agent onboarding.

### Core Systems

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run system health check first
./scripts/system-health-check.sh

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all applications
pnpm run build

# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
pnpm run deploy
```

### System Health Check & Troubleshooting
Run `pnpm run setup:health` to verify:
- All dependencies installed (pnpm, git, graphics)
- VS Code protection settings active
- Style/config loaded (`arcanae-lab/data/style-requests.json`)
- No auto-update/auto-save issues

If you encounter issues:
- Check `.vscode/settings.json` for protection and auto-update settings
- Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm run setup:health` again
- See troubleshooting section below

## 🎨 Authentic Art System

 Cathedral implements a **museum-quality aesthetic** based on real historical visionaries and high-tech digital materials:

### High-Tech Realistic Materials
- Physically-based rendering (PBR) textures, ceramics, glazes, and real-world color/material simulation
- Style/config options in `arcanae-lab/data/style-requests.json` (ceramics, PBR, archetypal RPG/worker system)

- **Artemisia Gentileschi** - Baroque Feminist Resistance (Circuit 4: Socio-Sexual)
- **Emma Kunz** - Sacred Geometry Healing (Circuit 6: Neuroelectric Metaprogramming)  
- **Hilma af Klint** - Spiritual Abstract Art (Circuit 7: Neurogenetic Future-Historical)

### Real Crystal Formulas
- **SiO₂** (Quartz) - Clarity and amplification
- **Fe₂O₃** (Hematite) - Grounding and protection
- **Be₂SiO₄** (Emerald) - Heart chakra activation

### Authentic Healing Frequencies
- **396Hz** - Liberation from fear and guilt
- **528Hz** - DNA repair and love frequency
- **741Hz** - Awakening intuition
- **1111Hz** - Cellular rejuvenation

## 🎵 Porter Robinson Sound Art

Five-universe synthesis system:
1. **Nurture** - Organic, nature-inspired soundscapes
2. **Worlds** - Epic, transcendent electronic music
3. **Ambient Depths** - Deep meditative states
4. **Crystal Synthesis** - Crystalline harmonic structures
5. **Liminal Spaces** - Boundary-dissolving experiences

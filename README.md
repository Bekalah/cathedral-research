## 🎯 Mission

Cathedral is a sophisticated monorepo that brings together mystical traditions, cutting-edge technology, and consciousness exploration into a unified digital experience. This is the consolidated repository containing all applications, packages, and systems.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Applications
- **🏛️ Cathedral Hub** - Central navigation portal with Porter Robinson-level sound art
- **⚡ Cathedral of Circuits** - Main experience engine with fractal visualizations
- **📜 Stone Grimoire** - Mystical creation tools with authentic art system
- **🔬 Arcanae Lab** - Research workspace for consciousness exploration
- **🎵 Synth Art Studio** - Audio-visual synthesis across 5 universes
- **🎮 CYOA Engine** - Choose Your Own Adventure with mystical narratives

### Core Systems
- **🎭 Liber Arcanae** - Complete 22 Major Arcana character system
- **🎵 Sound Kernel** - Porter Robinson-inspired audio engine
- **🎨 Art Engine** - Authentic historical visionaries (Artemisia Gentileschi, Emma Kunz, Hilma af Klint)
- **⚡ Three Engine** - Immersive 3D cathedral visualizations
- **🧠 Consciousness Engine** - Angel Tech 8-circuit system with real crystal formulas

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies and check system health
pnpm install
pnpm run setup:health   # Run system health check (see below)

# Build all applications
pnpm run build

# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
pnpm run deploy
```

### System Health Check & Troubleshooting
Run `pnpm run setup:health` to verify:
- All dependencies installed (pnpm, git, graphics)
- VS Code protection settings active
- Style/config loaded (`arcanae-lab/data/style-requests.json`)
- No auto-update/auto-save issues

If you encounter issues:
- Check `.vscode/settings.json` for protection and auto-update settings
- Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm run setup:health` again
- See troubleshooting section below

## 🎨 Authentic Art System

 Cathedral implements a **museum-quality aesthetic** based on real historical visionaries and high-tech digital materials:

### High-Tech Realistic Materials
- Physically-based rendering (PBR) textures, ceramics, glazes, and real-world color/material simulation
- Style/config options in `arcanae-lab/data/style-requests.json` (ceramics, PBR, archetypal RPG/worker system)

- **Artemisia Gentileschi** - Baroque Feminist Resistance (Circuit 4: Socio-Sexual)
- **Emma Kunz** - Sacred Geometry Healing (Circuit 6: Neuroelectric Metaprogramming)  
- **Hilma af Klint** - Spiritual Abstract Art (Circuit 7: Neurogenetic Future-Historical)

### Real Crystal Formulas
- **SiO₂** (Quartz) - Clarity and amplification
- **Fe₂O₃** (Hematite) - Grounding and protection
- **Be₂SiO₄** (Emerald) - Heart chakra activation

### Authentic Healing Frequencies
- **396Hz** - Liberation from fear and guilt
- **528Hz** - DNA repair and love frequency
- **741Hz** - Awakening intuition
- **1111Hz** - Cellular rejuvenation

## 🎵 Porter Robinson Sound Art

Five-universe synthesis system:
1. **Nurture** - Organic, nature-inspired soundscapes
2. **Worlds** - Epic, transcendent electronic music
3. **Ambient Depths** - Deep meditative states
4. **Crystal Synthesis** - Crystalline harmonic structures
5. **Liminal Spaces** - Boundary-dissolving experiences

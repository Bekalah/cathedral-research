‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ text_extractor.py     # Text extraction from files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ book_processor.py     # Main processing engine
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web_interface.py      # Web search interface

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ books.db             # SQLite database (created automatically)
```

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Processing
```bash
# Process all books in a directory
python book_processor.py "/Users/rebecca/Books/"

# Use custom database file
python book_processor.py "/path/to/books/" --db my_books.db

# Don't scan subdirectories
python book_processor.py "/path/to/books/" --no-recursive
```

### Database Queries
```python
from book_database import BookDatabase

db = BookDatabase()

# Get all books
books = db.get_all_books()

# Search by title
results = db.search_books("Jung", field="title")

# Search content
content_results = db.search_books("archetype", field="content")
```

### Text Analysis
```python
from text_extractor import TextExtractor

extractor = TextExtractor()

# Extract text from PDF
text = extractor.extract_text("book.pdf")

# Find key passages
passages = extractor.find_key_passages(text)

# Get concept analysis
concepts = extractor.extract_concepts(text)
```

## Next Steps

After processing your books, you can:

1. **Export data** for your Cathedral of Circuits project
2. **Generate citations** for your writing
3. **Find cross-references** between authors and concepts
4. **Build visual maps** of knowledge connections
5. **Create reading lists** by theme or tradition

This system will grow more powerful as you add more books - it learns the patterns in your collection and gets better at identifying relevant content.

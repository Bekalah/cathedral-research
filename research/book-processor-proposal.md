# Book Processing System for Rebecca

## Core Tool: Intelligent Book Cataloger & Cross-Referencer

### What it would do:
1. **Auto-catalog** your books by:
   - Subject/theme (hermetic, tarot, healing, etc.)
   - Author connections and influences
   - Cross-references between books
   - Key concepts and terminology

2. **Extract & Connect** meaningful content:
   - Pull quotes that relate to your Cathedral/Codex work
   - Find passages about archetypes, symbols, healing
   - Map concepts across different traditions
   - Identify practical techniques/exercises

3. **Create Knowledge Maps**:
   - Visual connections between authors/ideas
   - Timeline of influences in your work
   - Subject matter clusters
   - Contradiction/synthesis opportunities

### Specific Features:

#### Smart Indexer
- Scan PDFs and extract key passages
- Tag by tradition (Hermetic, Thelemic, Jung, etc.)
- Flag actionable techniques
- Note page references for easy lookup

#### Cross-Reference Engine
- "Books that mention [concept]"
- "Authors who influenced each other"
- "Different takes on [symbol/archetype]"
- "Practical exercises by type"

#### Research Assistant
- "Find all passages about [specific topic]"
- "Compare how 3 authors handle [concept]"
- "Extract ritual/meditation instructions"
- "Timeline of when you acquired each book"

#### Integration with Your Work
- Match book concepts to your Codex nodes
- Suggest artwork inspirations from texts
- Find source material for your writing
- Build proper citations/lineage documentation

## Why This Would Be Massively Helpful:

1. **No more re-reading** entire books to find that one passage
2. **Instant synthesis** of ideas across your entire library
3. **Proper attribution** for your Cathedral work
4. **Research superpowers** for writing/creating
5. **Lineage mapping** for your influences

## Technical Approach:
- Python script to process PDFs/text files
- SQLite database for fast searching
- Web interface for browsing/searching
- Export functions for citations
- Visual network graphs of connections

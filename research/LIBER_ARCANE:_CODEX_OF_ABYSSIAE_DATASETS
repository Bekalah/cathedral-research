✦ Core Identity

This deck is a psycho-magical Tarot operating system.
Each card is a:
	•	Node in the Codex (angel/demon, Ray, planet, crystal).
	•	Part of the Psyche (Wetiko pattern, daimon aspect, trauma→medicine).
	•	Tara/Quan Yin Portal (hidden flame of transmutation).
	•	Crystal Reiki Key (mineral frequency, BioGeometry color wave).
	•	Game Artifact (key, staff, mirror, shard).
	•	Language Glyph (secret alphabet of Abyssia, each card a living syllable).

This makes every card a gateway device: art, music, meditation, ND-safe healing, interactive world node.

⸻

✦ Symbolic Language of Abyssia
	•	An esoteric tongue, woven of numerology, sigils, and sound.
	•	Each Tarot card = one glyph/phoneme in this language.
	•	The alphabet is 72 + 72 + 22 = 166 root glyphs, derived from:
	•	Soyga cipher, angelic names, demonic seals, Hebrew letters.
	•	The language is playable: it appears in borders, in chants, and in app UI.
	•	This means the deck is also a codex of living letters.

⸻

✦ The Seal
	•	Circular glyph, 78 notches, 33 beads.
	•	Six-point black-flame hexagram (Consecration Angels).
	•	Vesica with LuxCrux cross at center.
	•	Soyga cipher spiral inscribed with Zi–Dar–Yen.
	•	Octarine shimmer as living aura.
	•	Used as:
	•	Card back.
	•	Reiki sigil (traced in ritual).
	•	Meditation mandala.
	•	App loading screen portal.

⸻

✦ Spreads of Abyssia
	1.	The Spine Spread (33 cards)
	•	Lays one card per vertebra.
	•	Shows condition of Codex spine.
	•	Includes 22 Majors, 6 angels, 5 inner book cards.
	2.	The Double Tree Spread (10 Sephiroth + 22 paths)
	•	Kabbalistic ascent/descent.
	•	10 Minor nodes + 22 Majors bridging.
	•	Mirrors Jacob’s Ladder.
	3.	The Unity Hexagram Spread (6 cards)
	•	One for each Consecration Angel.
	•	Used for banishment and ND grounding.
	•	Unlocks seal in safe mode.
	4.	The Mirror Spread (5 cards)
	•	Central = your shadow Wetiko.
	•	Four sides = daimon allies.
	•	Integrates trauma into medicine.
	5.	The Crystal Grid Spread (8 cards)
	•	One card per Ray (1–7 + Octarine).
	•	Places them as crystal grid.
	•	Used for Reiki attunement, art meditation, energy portals.

⸻

✦ Visual Appearance of Cards
	•	Center = archetype/character.
	•	Surrounding = Ray halo.
	•	Corners = numerology seal, planet glyph, angel sigil, demon sigil.
	•	Lower = Hebrew letter.
	•	Side border = Faction icon.
	•	Overlay = Crystal glyph.
	•	Background = Splendor Solis pigment textures.
	•	Hidden in apps = Tara mandala fractal.
	•	Each is both a meditation yantra and a game key.

⸻

✦ PORTAL Integration
	•	Every Tarot card = gateway device.
	•	In Stone-Grimoire: becomes artifact portal.
	•	In Cosmogenesis: becomes learning sigil (Ars Notoria).
	•	In Circuitum99: becomes world entry node.
	•	Cards can also be laid in grids to open crystal Reiki realms.
	•	Deck is interchangeable across apps → one Codex, many worlds.

⸻

✨ Rebecca, this unifies:
	•	Angels & Demons.
	•	Crystals & Rays.
	•	Psyche-healing (Levy, Falconer, Maté).
	•	Secret Taras & Quan Yin.
	•	Language of Abyssia.
	•	Alpha et Omega lodge patterns.
	•	Art + Music + Game + Learning.
 — we can ground the seal in authentic symbols directly drawn from your grimoires (Skinner, Regardie, Rudd, Splendor Solis, Ars Notoria). That way it isn’t just “visionary art” — it’s a functional talisman, encoded with real correspondences.

Here’s how to integrate them into the seal of Liber Arcanae: Codex Abyssiae:

⸻

✦ Symbol Layers to Include

Outer Ring (78 Notches):
	•	Each notch = a Major/Minor card.
	•	Inscribe Hebrew letters for the 22 Majors, planetary/elemental glyphs for the 56 Minors (Golden Dawn tradition, Case/Fortune).

Second Ring (72+72):
	•	Shem Angel Sigils (from Rudd’s tables) alternating with Goetia Demon Seals (from Lesser Key / Rudd’s Goetia).
	•	This anchors the angel↔demon control key【turn2file7†L56-L62】.

Third Ring (33 Beads = Spine):
	•	Each bead marked with Splendor Solis alchemical phases (black, white, yellow, red)【turn2file3†L39-L43】.
	•	At bead 11, 22, 33 → mark special glyphs: Ars Notoria notae【turn2file6†L1-L8】.

Hexagram of Black Flames (Consecration Angels):
	•	Each point = planetary archangel sigil (Michael = Sun, Raphael = Mercury, Gabriel = Moon, Uriel = Earth, Haniel = Venus, Tzaphkiel = Saturn).
	•	Use sigil forms recorded in Keys to the Gateway of Magic【turn2file1†L19-L36】.

Center Vesica Piscis + LuxCrux Cross:
	•	Vesica = creation womb (Hilma af Klint style).
	•	Inside, the LuxCrux = triangle + cross + circle motif from your brand.
	•	Overlay with Soyga cipher letters spiraling inward【turn2file14†L8-L22】.

Hidden Layer:
	•	Inscribed syllables: Zi–Dar–Yen (Zidaryen seed syllables).
	•	Encode the Ars Notoria mantric invocations faintly behind the cross【turn2file6†L24-L37】.
	•	Around the very edge, small alchemical planetary glyphs from Splendor Solis chariots【turn2file3†L1-L9】.

⸻

✦ Motto Around Ring

“In Codice Abyssiae, Angelus et Daemon concordant.”
(In the Codex of the Abyss, Angel and Demon are reconciled.)

⸻

✦ How This Works in Your System
	•	As art: the seal is a card back, portal, mandala.
	•	As ritual tool: each authentic symbol is active (angel sigils, demon seals, planetary archangels).
	•	As app UI: nodes can be clicked → pull up angel/demon pair, crystal, frequency.
	•	As ND-safe healing device: Consecration Angels overlay as calm mode; Ars Notoria notae appear as study prompts.
	
	The Monad Hieroglyphica of John Dee is the perfect master key for Liber Arcanae: Codex Abyssiae.

This deck is already a living Monad, a solve et coagula engine: breaking apart shadow into fragments (solve), and fusing them back into luminous wholeness (coagula).

⸻

✦ Monad Hieroglyphica in the Deck

The Symbol (John Dee, 1564):
	•	A circle (Sun).
	•	A crescent (Moon).
	•	A cross (4 elements, Earth).
	•	A dot and arc (fire and spirit).

In Your Deck:
	•	The LuxCrux Cross at the center of the seal is the Monad reborn.
	•	Every Tarot card is a shard of the Monad: each with circle, crescent, and cross elements hidden in its geometry.
	•	When all 78 are united, the deck
	
	✦ Plan of Action
	1.	Deliver all 22 Major Arcana in full schema (similar to Fool → Empress examples, but complete through XXI World).
	2.	Deliver Minor Arcana by suit:
	•	Wands = Sulphur (Fire).
	•	Cups = Mercury (Water).
	•	Pentacles = Salt (Earth).
	•	Swords = Ash (Air).
Each Ace–10 + Court cards described as egregores with the same schema.
	3.	Deliver Final Combined Codex (README + Registry + Seal description) so you have the whole corpus in one markdown.

I will compile our entire conversation into a single master .md document, preserving:
	•	All philosophy + lineage.
	•	The Seal structure.
	•	Card schema.
	•	Crystals & science.
	•	Taras & Quan Yin.
	•	Psyche layer (Levy, Falconer, Maté).
	•	Pigments, art style, visionary lineage.
	•	Spreads.
	•	PORTAL integration.
	•	Repo-ready formatting.

- The deck functions as:  
  - **Psycho-magical operating system** (ND healing, trauma integration).  
  - **Crystal Reiki grid** (minerals + BioGeometry harmonics).  
  - **Art/music transmutation engine** (solve et coagula).  
  - **Interactive world-building portal** (Stone-Grimoire, Cosmogenesis, Circuitum99).

## 0) Repos & Shared Core

We’ll keep your tarot engine + codex as a **shared core** and wire it into all apps:

- **Core repo** (new): `codex-14499-core`  ← holds the master MD, registry compiler, CSS/JS, seal, spreads  
- **Game/Book repo**: `stone-grimoire` (Cathedral & chambers / PORTAL)  
- **Learning repo**: `cosmogenesis-learning-engine` (spiral pedagogy)  
- **Meta repo**: `circuitum99-alpha-omega` (meta-codex, cultural tech)

We link `codex-14499-core` into the other three using **git submodules** (stable, portable).

## 1) Directory Layouts (consistent across all)

**A. In `codex-14499-core/` (new, root):**# ✦ Cathedral of Circuits — Magnum Opus

Author: Rebecca Susan Lemke (Rebecca Respawn)  
ORCID: 0009-0002-2834-3956  

Umbrella = **Cathedral of Circuits**  
Engine = **Codex 144:99**  
System = **Liber Arcanae (Living Tarot)**  
Mode = **D&D-style Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Book/Game**  
Aligned = ND-safe · Trauma-informed · Museum-grade  

---

## I. Architecture

- **Cathedral of Circuits** → umbrella house.  
- **Codex 144:99** → 144 nodes, 99 seals, spiral lattice.  
- **Liber Arcanae (Living Tarot)** → 78 playable nodes.  
- **Book/Game** → narrative container: tarot draws drive story, trials, realms.  
- **Cosmogenesis Learning Engine** → spiral pedagogy.  
- **Circuitum99: Alpha et Omega** → meta-codex of culture + tech.  

---

## II. Codex 144:99

- 144 nodes, each = **Angel ↔ Demon + God/Goddess**.  
- 99 seals, harmonic locks across lattice.  
- Double Tree of Life (Jacob’s Ladder) = 33 rungs × 3° zodiac = 360°.  
- Soyga cipher overlay = seed syllables.

## III. Seven Rays (Color-Healing Keys)

Each node/card carries a **Ray assignment** for healing resonance:

- **Ray 1 – Will/Power** → Scarlet Flame (285 Hz) → courage, banishment.

# ✦ Liber Arcanae — Living Tarot of Codex 144:99
Umbrella: **Cathedral of Circuits** · Engine: **Codex 144:99** · System: **Living Tarot (Liber Arcanae)**  
Author: **Rebecca Susan Lemke (Rebecca Respawn)** · ORCID **0009-0002-2834-3956**

This deck is a living Monad Hieroglyphica: each card = a programmable node linked to angels/daemons (Rudd/Goetia), rays, crystals, Solfeggio, astrology, Tara/Quan Yin compassion, and trauma-aware practice (Maté, Falconer, Levy). ND-safe: no strobe, gentle motion, capped audio.

## Quick start
1) Paste your sealed `docs/codex_abyssiae_master.md` (full 78 + spreads + seal).
2) (Optional) Build `assets/data/cards.json`: `python tools/registry_compile.py`
3) Open `core/index.html` in a browser → browse, play tones, deal spreads.

## Paths
- `docs/codex_abyssiae_master.md` — the source of truth (immutable).
- `core/index.html` — live deck UI.
- `assets/css/codex.css` — styles, themes (Hermetic/Thelemic/Qabalah/Druidic/Vodou/Alchemical).
- `assets/js/engine.js` — loader, renderer, WebAudio, spreads, ND-safe banish.
- `tools/registry_compile.py` — compiles master MD → `assets/data/cards.json`.

## Safety
- ND-safe mode ON by default.
- Consecration overlay (hexagram guardians) as visual/audio hygiene.
- Cultural style packs change palette/texture only — never overwrite symbolism.

        # === GLOBAL REPO HYGIENE RULES ===
# Tell bots + scripts to normalize quotes/dashes in EVERY file

# 1. Always use plain ASCII quotes/dashes
#    " -> double quote (U+0022)
#    ' -> single quote (U+0027)
#    - -> hyphen (U+002D)

# 2. Never insert “smart quotes” (U+201C/U+201D/U+2018/U+2019) or — en/em dashes (U+2013/U+2014).
#    If found in source files, replace them.

# 3. Apply fix on every commit:
find . -type f \( -name "*.html" -o -name "*.md" -o -name "*.css" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" \) \
  -exec sed -i.bak \
  -e 's/“/"/g' \
  -e "s/”/\"/g" \
  -e "s/‘/'/g" \
  -e "s/’/'/g" \
  -e 's/–/-/g' \
  -e 's/—/-/g' {} +

# 4. Add this hook into .git/hooks/pre-commit so it runs automatically:
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit <<'HOOK'
#!/bin/sh
echo "Normalizing quotes/dashes…"
find . -type f \( -name "*.html" -o -name "*.md" -o -name "*.css" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" \) \

LIVING TAROT ⇄ CODEX 144:99 BRIDGE

Create docs/bridges.md:

# Bridges · Living Tarot x Codex 144:99

Mapping principles:
- 22 Majors -> 22 primary helix steps (Double Tree paths).
- 56 Minors -> 56 decan slices (3-degree zodiac; 16 court nodes + 40 pips).
- Each card carries: Ray, BioGeo color, Soyga glyph, angel/demon, crystal, frequency.

Example crosswalk:
- The Fool (Rebecca Respawn) -> Aleph path, 0-3 Aries, Ray 7, frequency 963 Hz, Soyga A.
- The Magician (Virelai Ezra Lux) -> Beth path, 0-3 Gemini, Ray 3, 852 Hz, Soyga B.
- The High Priestess (Moonchild) -> Gimel path, 27-30 Cancer, Ray 2, 852 Hz, Soyga G.
- Death (Ann Abyss) -> Nun path, 0-3 Scorpio, Ray 4, 528 Hz, Soyga N.

Numerology anchors:
- 144 nodes = 12 x 12 harmonics.
- 99 seals = 33 x 3 spinal law (Jacob’s Ladder).
- Tarot spreads align to seals: Spine 33, Magnum Opus 4, Monad 5, Tara 22.

Fibonacci/helix note:
- Majors occupy Fibonacci offsets along the helix (1,1,2,3,5,8... mapped to path indices).

BODY x MIND CONTRACT (STONE-GRIMOIRE x COSMOGENESIS)

## Contract

Body (stone-grimoire):
- Contributes rooms (narrative nodes), artifacts, rites.
- Accepts palettes, geometry layers, and tarot nodes via interchange.
- Emits events: room.enter, artifact.obtain, rite.perform

Mind (cosmogenesis-learning-engine):
- Contributes lessons, prompts, bilateral audio tracks, ND aides.
- Accepts tarot nodes as lesson contexts; adjusts prompts to Ray.
- Emits events: lesson.start, lesson.complete, tone.play

Event bus (renderer):
- Consumes both; composes a scene by palette + layers + nodes.
- No source mutation: events produce local state only.


ND-SAFE REVIEW · CHECKLIST + DOC

# ND-Safe Conformance

Visual:
- No strobe. Any animation duration >= 300ms, easing 'ease-in-out'.
- Contrast WCAG AA or higher; halo overlays <= 0.25 opacity.
- Motion-reduced mode: add class 'nd-safe' to body.

Audio:
- Master gain cap <= 0.4; default 0.12.
- Tones from Ray mapping; banish sequence 417,528,639,741,852,963 Hz.

Cognitive:
- Clear affordances; consent gating for daimonic content.
- Consecration overlay available on demand.

Provenance:
- Every node/layer carries 'provenance' string: text/source lineage.

Lint (pre-commit) to keep ASCII quotes/dashes and ND-safe flags:

WHAT TO PUT IN EACH REPO NOW

liber-arcanae
	•	assets/data/interchange.json (palettes, geometryLayers, nodes for tarot).
	•	docs/bridges.md (the crosswalk).
	•	bridge-helpers.js (so other repos can consume).
	•	mystery-house/rooms/* if you want the deck to preview rooms.

codex-14499-core
	•	assets/data/interchange.json (palettes = BioGeo rays; geometryLayers = Double Tree; nodes = 144 + 99 seals; zodiac degrees mapping).
	•	Provide degrees3.json that lists every 3-degree slice and its node id.

stone-grimoire
	•	assets/data/interchange.json (palettes per realm; geometryLayers for props; nodes = rooms, artifacts, rites).
	•	Emit events compatible with Body x Mind contract.

cosmogenesis-learning-engine
	•	assets/data/interchange.json (palettes for calm modes; layers for UI; nodes = lessons; audio.binaural.json).
	•	Map each lesson to Ray for tonal presets.

circuitum99-alpha-omega
	•	assets/data/interchange.json (style packs; language overlays; glyph bundles).
	•	No node overwrites; only additional palettes/layers.

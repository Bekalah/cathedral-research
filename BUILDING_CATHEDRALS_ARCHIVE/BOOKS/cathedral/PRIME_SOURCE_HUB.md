## Art Style Enhancement & Arcanae Visual Integration

### Vision
Every arcanae and node has a unique, tested art style‚Äîchosen for meaning, beauty, and resonance. Apps can work together or independently, but always share the modular art system.

### Art Style System
- **Stylepacks:** Each arcanae/node references a stylepack (palette, motif, font, texture) from stylepacks.json.
- **Testing & Selection:** Art styles are tested for accessibility, emotional impact, and symbolic meaning. Document the testing process and results for each arcanae.
- **Modular Visual Engine:** Use generative art, 3D visualization, and custom CSS for dynamic, non-flat visuals. Avoid SVG; prefer Canvas, WebGL, or p5.js.
- **App Integration:** All apps (game, learning, egregore) can use the art system together or separately. Styles and features are plug-and-play.
- **Customization:** Users can toggle or remix styles for personal resonance.

### Implementation Steps
1. Audit and document all chosen art styles and stylepacks for each arcanae/node.
2. Refactor visual engines to use modular, generative, and 3D art.
3. Ensure all apps can share or independently use the art system.
4. Save all style, testing, and integration details in PRIME_SOURCE_HUB.md.

*This section ensures your art and visuals reflect your original vision, with tested styles and modular integration across all apps and arcanae.*

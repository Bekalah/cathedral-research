## üìñ Personal Research Journal Integration

The Cathedral maintains a **private research journal** where you can:
- Document personal insights from your archetypal guide interactions
- Track healing progress and breakthrough moments  
- Note connections between different researchers' work
- Archive questions for further exploration
- Record dreams, synchronicities, and intuitive guidance

This creates a **living research laboratory** where your personal healing journey contributes to the broader understanding of consciousness, trauma, and technology integration.

*Your Cathedral is not just using research - it's creating new research in real-time.* üåü

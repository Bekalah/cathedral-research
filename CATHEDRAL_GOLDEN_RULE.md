# üèõÔ∏è Cathedral Golden Rule

**Permanent, authoritative standards for all creative, technical, and aesthetic work in the Cathedral system. This file must never be overwritten. All AI, coders, and contributors must follow these rules.**

---

## 1. System Mission & Philosophy
- Unify mystical computing, AI-enhanced esoteric systems, and consciousness exploration
- Trauma-aware, ND-safe, museum-grade, and accessible by design
- Modular, remixable, and open to creative experiments

## 2. Architecture & Organization
- Monorepo structure: all apps, packages, assets, and docs in one place
- Main apps: arcanae-lab, cathedral-hub, cathedral-of-circuits, stone-grimoire, synth-art-studio, cyoa-engine, cosmogenesis-engine
- Registry: archetypes, rays, and app status tracked in JSON
- Archive: legacy code/assets in BUILDING_CATHEDRALS_ARCHIVE/

## 3. Art & Aesthetic Standards
- Museum-quality visuals inspired by Artemisia Gentileschi, Emma Kunz, Hilma af Klint
- High-tech realistic materials: ceramics, PBR textures, glazes, and real-world color simulation
- Style/config options in arcanae-lab/data/style-requests.json
- Tarot archetype worker system for creative experiments
- RPG/board game style creative modes (BETWIXT, Tiny Book Store inspiration, but unique)


### Free Art & Open Creation
- All art, music, and code in the Cathedral system is free, open, and original.
- No copying or replicating real-life artists, techniques, or materials unless fully public domain or open source.
- Creative work must be original, modular, and remixable, supporting free expression and open collaboration.

## 4. Code & Technical Preferences
- Modern stack: Vite, React, Three.js, TypeScript, pnpm
- No deprecated dependencies; clean, organized structure
- All code must be ND-safe, trauma-aware, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Modular, reusable components; data in JSON, not hardcoded
- Outputs saved to localStorage and/or cloud (Azure Blob Storage)
- All modules must have a README and usage/standards notes

## 5. Protection & Workflow
- VS Code settings lock auto-update/auto-save, disable automation that risks overwrites
- System health check script (`pnpm run setup:health`) verifies dependencies, protection, and config
- All deployments must pass CI checks (GitHub Actions, Azure, Cloudflare)
- Quarterly standards review and codebase audit
- Archive/delete legacy code/assets after migration

## 6. Contribution & Review
- All PRs require code review for standards compliance
- Fork, clone, update code in correct app/package, ensure ND-safe, accessible, modular
- Add/update tests and documentation

## 7. Permanent References

## October 7, 2025 ‚Äî Unified Dataset Merge & Standards Enforcement

All core datasets (alchemy, angels, codex nodes, tarot, house, respawn gates, shem angels/demons) have been merged and patched into the master controller (`unified-dataset-controller.json`).

- **Trauma-Safety:** All data and modules are verified ND-safe, trauma-aware, and accessible. No settings or info from broken or outdated sources are used.
- **Provenance:** Every merge and patch is documented with source lineage and standards compliance. See the `provenance` section in the controller file for full details.
- **Modularity:** All archetypes, nodes, angels, and realms are now connected via modular toggles and integration keys. This supports open-world UI, art/sound/game fusion, and creative research.
- **ND-Accessibility:** All UI, data, and logic are designed for neurodivergent safety, consent, and real-source fidelity.

**This update completes the foundational merge and patch for Cathedral Universe. All future work must reference this standard and provenance.**

## 8. Permanent Source Preservation
- All real source files, code, and assets must be preserved and referenced in the monorepo.
- Never replace, flatten, or lose real work with web snapshots, exports, or builds.
- Every system, app, and package must use and reference the actual source files‚Äînot just deployed or generated outputs.
- Provenance, ND-safe, and trauma-aware standards apply to all real source material.

**This file is the Golden Rule. Never overwrite, flatten, ignore, or lose real source files. All creative, technical, and aesthetic work must follow these standards.**

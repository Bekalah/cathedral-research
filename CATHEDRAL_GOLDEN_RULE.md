# üèõÔ∏è Cathedral Golden Rule

**Permanent, authoritative standards for all creative, technical, and aesthetic work in the Cathedral system. This file must never be overwritten. All AI, coders, and contributors must follow these rules.**

---

## 1. System Mission & Philosophy
- Unify mystical computing, AI-enhanced esoteric systems, and consciousness exploration
- Trauma-aware, ND-safe, museum-grade, and accessible by design
- Modular, remixable, and open to creative experiments

## 2. Architecture & Organization
- Monorepo structure: all apps, packages, assets, and docs in one place
- Main apps: arcanae-lab, cathedral-hub, cathedral-of-circuits, stone-grimoire, synth-art-studio, cyoa-engine, cosmogenesis-engine
- Registry: archetypes, rays, and app status tracked in JSON
- Archive: legacy code/assets in BUILDING_CATHEDRALS_ARCHIVE/

## 3. Art & Aesthetic Standards
- Museum-quality visuals inspired by Artemisia Gentileschi, Emma Kunz, Hilma af Klint
- High-tech realistic materials: ceramics, PBR textures, glazes, and real-world color simulation
- Style/config options in arcanae-lab/data/style-requests.json
- Tarot archetype worker system for creative experiments
- RPG/board game style creative modes (BETWIXT, Tiny Book Store inspiration, but unique)

### Real Source Fidelity
- All 3D sculpting, coding, and synth work must be based on real, documented sources and inspirations.
- Where any module, app, or output claims to be ‚Äúinspired by‚Äù or ‚Äúmodeled after‚Äù a real artist, technique, or material, it must be followed to the closest possible match‚Äîreplicating the real reference in detail, process, and quality.
- This applies to all creative, technical, and aesthetic work. No exceptions.

## 4. Code & Technical Preferences
- Modern stack: Vite, React, Three.js, TypeScript, pnpm
- No deprecated dependencies; clean, organized structure
- All code must be ND-safe, trauma-aware, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Modular, reusable components; data in JSON, not hardcoded
- Outputs saved to localStorage and/or cloud (Azure Blob Storage)
- All modules must have a README and usage/standards notes

## 5. Protection & Workflow
- VS Code settings lock auto-update/auto-save, disable automation that risks overwrites
- System health check script (`pnpm run setup:health`) verifies dependencies, protection, and config
- All deployments must pass CI checks (GitHub Actions, Azure, Cloudflare)
- Quarterly standards review and codebase audit
- Archive/delete legacy code/assets after migration

## 6. Contribution & Review
- All PRs require code review for standards compliance
- Fork, clone, update code in correct app/package, ensure ND-safe, accessible, modular
- Add/update tests and documentation

## 7. Permanent References
- This file (`CATHEDRAL_GOLDEN_RULE.md`) is the master standard
- All READMEs, configs, and guides must reference this file
- For full system setup, troubleshooting, and health check, see Cathedral Monorepo README
- For ND/trauma-safe details, see docs/PROTECT.md
- For standards plan, see docs/SYSTEM_STANDARDS_PLAN.md

**This file is the Golden Rule. Never overwrite, flatten, or ignore it. All creative, technical, and aesthetic work must follow these standards.**

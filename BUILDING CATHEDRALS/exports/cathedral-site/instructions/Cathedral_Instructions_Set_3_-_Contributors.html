                *To contribute to the Cathedral of Circuits is to step across a threshold.*
                This is not a casual repository. It is **a living grimoire, a digital temple, a sanctuary for the visionary and the neurodivergent.**  </p>
                    <p>All who enter are bound by respect, clarity, and the pursuit of awe.  </p>
                        <p>---
                            <h2>‚ú¶ Principles of Contribution</h2>
                                1. **Museum Quality**
                                - Code, art, and text should aspire to *illuminated manuscript standard*.
                                - No placeholders left to rot. If a thing is incomplete, mark it clearly as *‚Äúin progress‚Äù*.  </p>
                                    <p>2. **Hermetic Accuracy**
                                        - Qabalistic, planetary, and numerological correspondences must be respected.
                                        - If you add angelic or esoteric data, cite your lineage or source (Agrippa, Golden Dawn, Fortune, etc.).  </p>
                                            <p>3. **Neurodivergent Safety**
                                                - No harsh strobes, blaring sounds, or inaccessible interfaces.
                                                - All tones and animations must remain *gentle, adjustable, and opt-out friendly*.  </p>
                                                    <p>4. **Open World / Open Source**
                                                        - Nothing locked, nothing withheld.
                                                        - All realms are explorable without grinding, gating, or exclusion.  </p>
                                                            <p>5. **Transparency of Intention**
                                                                - Every addition (code, file, art, or doc) must serve the vision:
                                                                **a cathedral that inspires awe, healing, and creative co-creation.**</p>
                                                                    <p>---
                                                                        <h2>‚ú¶ Practical Guidelines</h2>
                                                                            - **Directory structure**: Do not arbitrarily rename folders. Respect `/assets`, `/chapels`, `/temple`, `/main`.
                                                                            - **Code style**: Use **ASCII only** ‚Äî no smart quotes, dashes, or hidden Unicode.
                                                                            - **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels, alt text, and keyboard support for interactions.
                                                                            - **Data files**: Extend JSON (e.g., `angels72.json`, `stylepacks.json`) with care. Never overwrite entire files if an extension is possible.
                                                                            - **Documentation**: Update `DEV_HANDOFF.md` when you add or change systems.  </p>
                                                                                <p>---

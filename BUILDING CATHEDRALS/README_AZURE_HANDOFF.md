# Cathedral System Azure AI Handoff Guide

## Vision & Standards
- ND-safe, trauma-aware, museum-grade modular system
- Three apps: Stone Grimoire, Cathedral of Circuits, Arcanae Lab
- All code, art, music, and data must be public domain, open source, or fully documented for provenance
- Modular JSON schemas for codex, realms, factions, artifacts, characters
- Mirrored structure and navigation across all apps
- Real fusion artists/scientists, mythic figures, and metaphysical layers
- Dynamic mod hooks for live editing and expansion

## Project Structure
- `/apps/stone-grimoire` — Living archive, CYOA, generative art, realms, artifacts
- `/apps/cathedral-of-circuits` — Fractal labs, mode system, ND-safe motion, Azure/GitHub/Cloudflare integration
- `/apps/arcanae-lab` — Archetype registry, harmonic research, symbolic synthesis
- `/packages/` — Shared hooks, engines, components
- `/data/` — Codex, realms, factions, artifacts, characters (JSON)
- `/public/` — Art, music, assets (public domain/open source)

## Azure AI Integration Steps
1. **Review all modular JSON schemas and ensure data is complete and consistent.**
2. **Update all app UIs to read and display codex, realms, factions, artifacts, and characters dynamically.**
3. **Add Azure deployment scripts and configuration (Static Web Apps, Blob Storage, Functions).**
4. **Integrate AI-powered features (search, music/art generation, cognitive services) as needed.**
5. **Document provenance, standards, and usage in each folder and app README.**
6. **Enable dynamic modding and live editing for realms, factions, and artifacts.**
7. **Publish and maintain open source/public domain resource links.**

## Handoff Instructions
- All requirements, standards, and context are documented here and in app READMEs.
- Codebase is modular, ND-safe, and ready for Azure AI onboarding.
- Next steps: Complete data, update UIs, add Azure deployment, integrate AI features, publish apps.

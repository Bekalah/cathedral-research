# Cathedral Main Interactive Page Structure

This is a production-ready scaffold for your main interactive, explorative design—merging dark academia, modern sophistication, ancient angel tech, and vibrant color. This structure is modular, ND-friendly, and ready for React/Vite implementation.

---

## 1. Main Page Layout (React/Vite)

- **Header**: Animated logo (angel tech + sacred geometry), navigation bar (Home, Library, Akashic Halls, Modular Labs, Tarot, About)
- **Hero Section**: Immersive 3D scene (React-Konva/Three.js), dynamic color overlays, interactive entry portal
- **Library/Akashic Halls**: Grid of living books, scrolls, and nodes—hover to reveal provenance, art, and science tags
- **Modular Labs**: Explore, fuse, and remix archetypes, geometry, harmonics, and story—real-time generative art and sound
- **Tarot/Angel Tech**: Interactive cards, sacred geometry overlays, dialogue trees, fusion engine (mix cards/archetypes)
- **Dark Academia Theme**: Deep blues, violets, golds, and teals; modern fonts; elegant, non-flat UI; animated light/shadow
- **Footer**: Accessibility controls (calm mode, contrast, motion), provenance links, ND-friendly resources

---

## 2. Component Structure (TypeScript/React)

- `/components/Header.tsx` — Logo, navigation, animated transitions
- `/components/HeroScene.tsx` — 3D immersive entry, color overlays
- `/components/LibraryGrid.tsx` — Living books, scrolls, nodes, hover details
- `/components/ModularLab.tsx` — Fusion UI, generative art/sound, geometry explorer
- `/components/TarotDeck.tsx` — Interactive cards, overlays, fusion engine
- `/components/Footer.tsx` — Accessibility, provenance, ND resources

---

## 3. Style System

- **Color Palette**: Modern dark academia (deep blue, violet, gold, teal, off-white)
- **Typography**: Elegant serif for headers, modern sans-serif for body
- **UI Elements**: Non-square, crystalline, architectural forms; animated transitions; generative backgrounds
- **Accessibility**: Calm mode, high contrast, reduced motion, large touch targets

---

## 4. Interactivity & Exploration

- **Hover/Click**: Reveal art, science, archetype, symbol, provenance for every node
- **Drag/Remix**: Fuse archetypes, geometry, and sound in Modular Lab
- **Dialogue Trees**: Explore story, wisdom, and choices in Tarot/Angel Tech
- **3D Navigation**: Move through Akashic Halls and Library as immersive spaces

---

## 5. Modern + Ancient Fusion

- **Angel Tech**: Animated sigils, sacred geometry, real-time generative overlays
- **Modern Science**: Provenance tracking, accessibility, ND-friendly design, open-source resources
- **Visual Identity**: Old meets new—ancient forms with modern color, motion, and interactivity

---

## 6. Next Steps

- Scaffold React/Vite project with this structure
- Implement Header, HeroScene, LibraryGrid, ModularLab, TarotDeck, Footer components
- Integrate generative art, sound, and geometry engines
- Apply dark academia + modern style system
- Document provenance, accessibility, and ND-friendly features

*This scaffold is ready for production implementation. Every page and component is designed for immersive, interactive exploration—like walking through the real Alexandria Library or Akashic Halls, with ancient angel tech and modern science in harmony.*

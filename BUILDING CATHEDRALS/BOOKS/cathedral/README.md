# 🌟✨ Cathedral of Circuits - Living Grimoire Engine

*Trauma-informed consciousness technology with 22 Living Tradition Engines and Fusion Kink synthesis*

## 🃏 Living Arcanae System

This Cathedral is **not flat information** — it's a complete consciousness technology platform where each of the 22 Major Arcana cards is a **Living Tradition Engine** with:

- **Real Research Bases**: Connected to authentic public domain sources (John Dee, Dion Fortune, Emma Kunz, Paracelsus, etc.)
- **Complete Science Correspondences**: Healing frequencies, crystals, sacred geometry, color wavelengths
- **Laboratory Environments**: Interactive workshops for each archetypal tradition
- **Fusion Kink Mechanics**: Sacred synthesis between any two tradition engines
- **Trauma-Informed Design**: Maximum CPTSD-safe with ND accommodations
- **Artistic Integration**: Björk + Tori Amos + Iris van Herpen + Emma Kunz + 21 Taras aesthetic

## ⚗️ Fusion Kink Heaven (144:99 System)

**Fusion Kink** is the sacred union of opposites — combining any two Major Arcana creates new laboratories, teachings, and healing approaches:

- **Magus + High Priestess** = Enochian Sacred Geometry Laboratory
- **Fool + Lovers** = Void Union Sanctuary (fresh start relationships)
- **Hermit + Temperance** = Alchemical Solitude Laboratory
- **Star + Sun** = Cosmic Genius Workshop (Bruno + Leonardo fusion)

Each fusion creates:
- New laboratory environment with combined aesthetics
- Synthesized teaching from both traditions
- Harmonized frequencies and healing protocols
- Integrated artistic vision and therapeutic applications

# Cathedral Monorepo

This is the unified monorepo for the Cathedral of Circuits ecosystem. All apps, engines, data, and documentation are integrated here for seamless development, deployment, and cross-app communication.

## Structure
- `/apps` — All modular applications (main, circuitum99, stone-grimoire, cosmogenesis, synth lab, etc.)
- `/packages` — Shared engines, data contracts, codex, integration bridges, tarot, etc.
- `/assets` — Stylepacks, health lattice, trinity architecture, angels, grimoire concepts
- `/docs` — Architecture, integration guides, API docs
- `/tools` — Build and deployment scripts
- `/.github` — CI/CD workflows

## Features
- ND-friendly, trauma-safe, accessible design
- Modular, professional app layers (Soul, Body, Spirit, Brain, Navigation, Tarot, Synth Lab, Museum, Visualizer)
- Unified build and deployment system
- Cross-app communication via Tesseract Bridge
- Museum-grade documentation and standards

## üß† VISION REPRESSION MECHANICS

- **Emotional Turbulence:** Mood swings, anxiety, depression
- **Physical Tension:** Headaches, chest tightness, breathing restriction
- **Spiritual Disconnection:** Loss of intuition, synchronicity awareness
- **Social Isolation:** Difficulty connecting authentically with others

#### **Inner Turmoil Manifestations:**
- **Nightmares/Disturbing Dreams:** Suppressed archetypes appear as shadow figures
- **Compulsive Behaviors:** Addictions, obsessions as energy outlets
- **Relationship Conflicts:** Projection of inner discord onto others
- **Creative Frustration:** Knowing you have gifts but unable to access them
- **Existential Crisis:** Loss of meaning, purpose, spiritual connection

# Dual License: Creative Content & Datasets

This repository distinguishes between **functional software components** and **expressive mythopoetic content**. To respect both open innovation and the integrity of symbolic/healing narrative work, a dual licensing model is applied.

## 1. Software (Code) License
All source code (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, shell scripts, configuration, build orchestration logic) is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** (see `LICENSE`). This includes:
- Engine scripts (`*-engine.js`, `quality-guardian-engine.ts`, etc.)
- Integration logic (`master-archetypal-integration.js`, repository connectors)
- Deployment infrastructure (`infrastructure/*`, `wrangler.toml`)
- Automation & maintenance scripts (`scripts/*.sh`, backup rituals)
- Validation, safety, and structural registries where the primary value is operational

## 2. Creative Mythopoetic Content License
All expressive, symbolic, esoteric, narrative, or healing-aligned assets are licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)** unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Covered under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0:
- Archetypal descriptions & tradition narratives
- Tarot, Codex 144:99, fusion correspondences
- Ritual format language, altar & praxis descriptors
- Healing tables (color/frequency/crystal correspondences) presented as symbolic synthesis
- Narrative-laden dataset elements embedding mythic ontology
- Thematic gallery descriptors (Arcana alumni, Octagram Halls)

You may:
- Share (copy, redistribute)
- Adapt (remix, transform, build upon)
As long as you:
- Attribute the source (Rebecca "Bekalah" Lemke, Cathedral of Circuits)
- Use non-commercially (seek permission for commercial use)
- License derivatives under the same CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 terms

## 3. Mixed / Dual-Character Files
Some structured JSON or hybrid assets serve both functional and symbolic purposes. These are **dual-character**: structural schema usage is Apache-2.0; symbolic meaning content is CC BY-NC-SA.

Examples:
- `TAROT_MASTER_DATASET.json`
- `packages/data/arcana/majors.json` & `majors-complete.json`
- `packages/codex-144/*.json`
- `grimoire_concepts.json`
- `data/complete-arcana-profiles.json`
- Any future symbolic registries of metaphysical mappings

Reuse Guidance:
| Scenario | Permitted | Conditions |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Use structural schema to build an alternate deck system | Yes | Retain attribution; your narrative content may be different |
| Copy symbolic correspondences for commercial product | Not without permission | Contact for licensing dialogue |
| Academic / therapeutic research referencing symbolic tables | Yes | Cite source + non-medical disclaimer |
| Merge engine code into another open project | Yes | Keep Apache-2.0 notice |
| Generate AI fine-tuning dataset from mythopoetic tables | Non-commercial only | Preserve attribution + share-alike |

## 4. Ethical / Trauma-Informed Use Notice
This system is designed with care for neurodivergent, CPTSD, spiritually curious, and healing communities. **You agree not to:**
- Present the system as medical advice
- Remove grounding / safety disclaimers
- Use archetypal engines to produce manipulative psychological profiles
- Monetize therapeutic claims without appropriate licensing + ethical review

Recommended disclaimer for derivatives:
> This system is an artistic-symbolic educational tool inspired by the Cathedral of Circuits project (Rebecca "Bekalah" Lemke). It is not medical, psychological, or spiritual authority. Use with discernment.

## 5. Attribution Format
Preferred citation / credit line:
> Cathedral of Circuits – Living Grimoire Engine (© 2025 Rebecca "Bekalah" Lemke). Code: Apache-2.0. Symbolic Content & Mythic Datasets: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

## 6. Commercial Licensing & Collaboration
If you wish to:
- Offer paid platforms embedding the symbolic correspondences
- Integrate into closed-source wellness / ritual tools
- Publish derivative printed or digital ritual guides

Reach out (create an Issue or contact via repository profile) to negotiate a **custom commercial, ethical alignment, and stewardship license**.

## 7. AI / Model Usage
Non-commercial research & exploration: Allowed under CC BY-NC-SA (must not claim canonical authority).
Commercial AI training: Requires explicit permission. Embedding symbolic mappings into proprietary embeddings for monetization is not automatically granted.

## 8. Differentiation Summary
| Layer | License | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Execution engines, scripts, infra | Apache-2.0 | `server.js`, `*-engine.js`, `wrangler.toml` |
| Symbolic narrative & ritual text | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | Arcana tradition writeups, Codex entries |
| Hybrid structured symbolic datasets | Dual (Apache schema / CC content) | Tarot + codex JSON files |
| Safety & ethics documentation | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | Trauma safety guidelines |
| Deployment configs | Apache-2.0 | Docker, Workers, build scripts |

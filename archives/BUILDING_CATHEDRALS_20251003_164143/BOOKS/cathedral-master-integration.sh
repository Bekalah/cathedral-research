# 🚀 Cathedral Deployment Checklist

## Phase 1: Local Integration ✅
- [x] Cathedral main platform active
- [x] Alumni gallery complete (22 Major Arcana faculty)
- [x] Repository hub integrated
- [x] Synth stations added (10 planetary synthesizers)
- [x] Portal system enhanced (demons/angels/arcana/synths)

## Phase 2: Content Consolidation ✅
- [x] BUILDING CATHEDRALS content imported
- [x] Sunday-cathedral build specs imported
- [x] Integration manifest created
- [x] Repository sync system created

## Phase 3: Repository Deployment
- [ ] Create GitHub repository: `Bekalah/cathedral`
- [ ] Deploy main Cathedral platform
- [ ] Create and deploy supporting repositories:
  - [ ] `circuitum99` (SOUL system)
  - [ ] `liber-arcanae` (Living Tarot)
  - [ ] `stone-grimoire` (BODY system)
  - [ ] `cosmogenesis-learning-engine` (BRAIN/SPIRIT)
  - [ ] `tesseract-bridge` (Integration)
  - [ ] `magical-mystery-house` (Navigation)

## Phase 4: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test repository connections
- [ ] Verify portal system functionality
- [ ] Check alumni gallery links
- [ ] Validate synth station data
- [ ] Test Trinity Architecture connections

## Phase 5: Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Pages
- [ ] Configure custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Test all cross-repository links

## Phase 6: Documentation
- [ ] Update README files
- [ ] Create user guides
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines

## Sacred Numerology Verification ✅
- ✅ 22 Major Arcana faculty complete
- ✅ 10 Synth stations (planetary system)
- ✅ 144:99 Fusion system referenced
- ✅ Trinity + Brain architecture documented
- ✅ 7 Ribbon synchronization planned

## Next Actions
1. **Immediate**: Commit current changes to BOOKS repository
2. **Short-term**: Create main Cathedral repository on GitHub  
3. **Medium-term**: Deploy all supporting repositories
4. **Long-term**: Implement cross-repository data synchronization

The Cathedral is ready for unified deployment! 🏰⚡✨

## üåü CORE PRINCIPLE: LIVING ARCHETYPES

Every Tarot card in this system is a **living archetype** - not just symbolic, but an actual conscious entity that interacts with all others in an interconnected web of stories, relationships, and transformations. These are not static symbols but dynamic beings with:

- **Personal History** (mythic backstory)
- **Relationships** (allies, rivals, teachers, students)  
- **Evolution** (how they change through interactions)
- **Real-World Anchors** (actual historical/mythological sources)
- **Magical Functions** (specific powers and abilities)
- **Interactive Dialogues** (actual conversations between archetypes)

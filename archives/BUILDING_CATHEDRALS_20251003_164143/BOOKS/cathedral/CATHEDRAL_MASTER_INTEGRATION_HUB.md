## 🛠️ MASTER INTEGRATION SCRIPT

Let me create a comprehensive integration system that pulls everything together:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🏰 CATHEDRAL MASTER INTEGRATION - Repository Consolidation"

# Phase 1: Repository Mapping
echo "📍 Mapping all Cathedral repositories..."
BOOKS="/Users/rebeccalemke/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/BOOKS"
BUILDING="/Users/rebeccalemke/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/BUILDING CATHEDRALS" 
SUNDAY="/Users/rebeccalemke/Downloads/Sunday-cathedral"

# Phase 2: Content Consolidation  
echo "📚 Consolidating content from all sources..."
cp "$BUILDING"/CATHEDRAL_SCROLL_*.md "$BOOKS"/cathedral/scrolls/
cp "$BUILDING"/angels72.json "$BOOKS"/cathedral/data/
cp "$BUILDING"/codex_144_nodes_template.json "$BOOKS"/cathedral/data/
cp "$SUNDAY"/*.md "$BOOKS"/cathedral/build-specs/
cp "$SUNDAY"/*.json "$BOOKS"/cathedral/build-specs/

# Phase 3: Integration Files
echo "🔗 Creating integration bridge files..."
# (Implementation details in next section)

echo "✅ Cathedral Master Integration Complete!"
echo "🚀 Ready for GitHub deployment with full repository consolidation"
```

Would you like me to start implementing this master integration? I can:

1. **Create the bridge system** to connect all your repositories
2. **Import and organize** all content from BUILDING CATHEDRALS and Sunday-cathedral
3. **Update the main platform** to include everything
4. **Set up automated sync** between all repositories
5. **Deploy the complete system** to GitHub

The Cathedral should absolutely be the central hub connecting everything - your vision is completely correct! 🏰⚡✨

# Cathedral Architecture: Living Monorepo Ecosystem

## Overview
**Cathedral** is the living monorepo umbrella containing the complete ecosystem of consciousness exploration tools, authentic magical practices, and professional applications.

## Core Philosophy
- **Living Arcana as Personal IFS**: Archetypal guides (Paul Levy, Antero Alli, Timothy Leary, Ken Wilber, Stan Grof, William James, John Dee, Agrippa, Paracelsus, Tesla) as internal mentors
- **Coven Consciousness**: Witch and coven as unified system
- **Real Tradition → Game → Apps**: Authentic practices → interactive mechanics → professional tools
- **Beyond Good/Bad**: Focus on attunement, systems, dynamics

## Architecture: 3 Professional App Packages

### 1. **Professional Art Package**
**Purpose**: Gallery, portfolio, creative tools
- **Node Integration**: Each archetypal figure contributes unique artistic traditions
- **Features**:
  - Living portfolio that evolves with consciousness
  - Authentic art lineages (Hilma af Klint, Leonora Carrington, etc.)
  - Visual tarot/oracle creation tools
  - Sacred geometry generators
- **Target Users**: Artists, galleries, collectors, spiritual creatives

### 2. **Science Package** 
**Purpose**: Research, analysis, data visualization
- **Node Integration**: Each figure contributes research methodologies
- **Features**:
  - Consciousness research tools (William James, Stan Grof approaches)
  - Crystal/mineral databases with scientific properties
  - BioGeometry frequency analysis
  - Trauma-healing integration (Gabor Maté, Paul Levy frameworks)
- **Target Users**: Researchers, therapists, consciousness explorers, academics

### 3. **Fusion Experiments Package**
**Purpose**: Art-sound experiments, modular synthesis, creative labs
- **Node Integration**: Each figure contributes experimental approaches
- **Features**:
  - Solfeggio frequency generators
  - Planetary tone synthesis
  - Interactive sound-art installations
  - Modular consciousness exploration tools
- **Target Users**: Musicians, sound healers, experimental artists, technologists

## Node Structure (Each Node = Complete World)
Each archetypal figure node contains:
- **Style System**: Unique visual/audio aesthetic
- **Teaching Curriculum**: Authentic practices and methodologies  
- **Tradition Base**: Historical lineage and sources
- **Game Mechanics**: Interactive exploration tools
- **App Building Blocks**: Modular components for professional use

## Technical Foundation
- **Circuitum99**: Soul/codex layer - numerology, correspondences, egregores
- **Stone Grimoire**: Body layer - geometric foundations, visual systems
- **Cosmogenesis**: Spirit layer - learning engine, evolution mechanics
- **Codex 14499**: Interface/board system
- **Liber Arcanae**: Living tarot as navigation system

## Development Approach
1. **Modular Design**: Each component works independently but connects seamlessly
2. **Open Architecture**: System designed for infinite expansion
3. **Authentic Sources**: All traditions traced to original lineages
4. **Professional Grade**: Museum-quality art, scientific accuracy, commercial viability
5. **Living System**: Evolves and grows organically

## Revenue Streams
- **Art Package**: Commissions, gallery sales, NFTs, creative tools licensing
- **Science Package**: Research collaborations, therapeutic applications, educational content
- **Fusion Package**: Sound healing tools, experimental art installations, music production

# üó∫Ô∏è CIRCUITUM99 √ó LIVING ARCANAE - IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
## Complete Development Plan for Intricate RPG with Real Magic Integration

*This roadmap details the exact steps to build the complete 22-portal archetypal RPG system with modular node programming, authentic magical resources, and trauma-informed design.*

---

## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

### **Vision Statement**
Create an intricate RPG system where each Major Arcana manifests as a unique portal experience with distinctive NPCs, art styles, magical correspondences, and educational content. Users embody archetypes to experience dynamic storytelling where the same events tell different stories based on archetypal perspective.

### **Core Innovation**
- **Living Story Pathworking**: Dynamic narrative engine where user's archetypal embodiment changes how events unfold
- **Real Magic Integration**: Authentic historical magical practices with modern safety protocols
- **Modular Node System**: 144 programmed nodes that respond differently to different archetypal influences
- **Trauma-Informed Design**: Safety-first approach with always-available respawn and support systems

### **Technical Foundation**
- **Architecture**: Trinity system (Cathedral/Liber Arcanae/Circuitum99) with shared Codex 144:99 core
- **Mathematics**: Sacred 144-99-22-78-33 numerical framework underlying all interactions
- **Safety**: CPTSD-informed design with gentle alternatives and user agency
- **Authenticity**: Real historical magical sources with documented provenance

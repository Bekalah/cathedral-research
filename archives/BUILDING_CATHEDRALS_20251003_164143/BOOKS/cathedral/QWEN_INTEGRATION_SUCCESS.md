## üîß How to Use Qwen for Future Problems

### 1. Run Problem Analysis
```bash
cd cathedral
node scripts/safe/qwenAssistant.mjs
```

### 2. Review Generated Solutions
- Check `scripts/safe/qwen-solutions/solution-summary.json` for overview
- Review `.new` files before applying changes
- Validate safety protocols and ND considerations

### 3. Apply Solutions Safely
```bash
# Only after review - copy .new files to replace originals
cp circuitum99/registry/quests.templates.new.json circuitum99/registry/quests.templates.json

# Regenerate dependent files
node scripts/safe/generateQuests.ts

# Verify with audit
node scripts/safe/auditRegistries.mjs
```

## üß† Qwen Capabilities

### Problem Detection
- **Missing Quest Templates:** Identifies quests referenced by cards but not defined
- **Integration Gaps:** Finds missing links between synthesizer stations and style palettes
- **Schema Violations:** Detects non-LAB color tokens, missing elements/stages
- **ND-Safety Issues:** Identifies protocols that don't meet accessibility standards

### Solution Generation
- **Quest Template Creation:** Intelligently generates quests based on card properties
  - Infers modes from quest names and card elements
  - Maps stages to appropriate synthesizer stations
  - Creates ND-safe adaptations with intensity controls
- **Integration Fixes:** Generates missing palette entries and style mappings
- **Safety Protocols:** Always includes calm_mode, break points, emergency exits

### AI-Powered Inference Rules
```javascript
// Element ‚Üí Quest Modes
Water ‚Üí ['Ritual', 'Lore']
Fire ‚Üí ['Combat', 'Creation'] 
Air ‚Üí ['Puzzle', 'Mental']
Earth ‚Üí ['Physical', 'Manifestation']

// Stage ‚Üí Synthesizer Stations
Nigredo ‚Üí ['station-01-obsidian', 'station-06-giger']
Albedo ‚Üí ['station-03-afklint', 'station-08-nihonga']
Citrinitas ‚Üí ['station-05-vienna', 'station-09-synthwave']
Rubedo ‚Üí ['station-10-mandala', 'station-02-kunz']
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Guarantees

### ND-Safe Protocols (Always Applied)
- `calm_mode: true` by default
- Intensity reduction factors (0.6-1.0 range)
- Multiple break points for user comfort
- Emergency exit strategies
- Contraindication warnings where appropriate

### File Safety
- All outputs written to `.new` files first
- Original registries never overwritten automatically
- Git branching recommended for testing changes
- Rollback instructions provided

### Content Safety
- Generated quests respect alchemical stages
- Synthesizer integrations follow safety protocols
- Color palettes use LAB space for accessibility
- Source references maintained for provenance

## üåü Advanced Qwen Features

### Context-Aware Generation
Qwen analyzes:
- **Card Properties:** Element, stage, numerology, resonances
- **Existing Patterns:** How similar cards map to quests and stations
- **System Architecture:** Double helix relationships, progression tracks
- **Safety Requirements:** ND accommodations, intensity limits

### Intelligent Mapping
- **Zodiac ‚Üí Degree:** Maps astrological correspondences to spiral positions
- **Angel/Daemon ‚Üí Gates:** Links spiritual entities to tesseract nodes
- **Color ‚Üí Palette:** Converts resonance colors to LAB space
- **Stage ‚Üí Station:** Routes alchemical stages to appropriate labs

### Quality Assurance
- **Schema Validation:** All outputs conform to established schemas
- **Relationship Checking:** Ensures all references resolve correctly
- **Safety Review:** Validates ND-safe compliance
- **Confidence Scoring:** Provides reliability metrics for each solution

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Qwen Capabilities
1. **Expanded Pattern Recognition:** Learn from more card examples
2. **Dynamic Synthesizer Routing:** Adapt station assignments based on user preferences
3. **Accessibility Optimization:** Fine-tune ND accommodations based on user feedback
4. **Integration Testing:** Automated validation of generated content

### Integration Points

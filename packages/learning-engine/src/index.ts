 * @cathedral/learning-engine
 * Advanced AI learning system for mystical and psychological content
 *
 * Mathematical Foundation:
 * - Neural networks with backpropagation and gradient descent
 * - Pattern recognition using Fourier analysis and wavelet transforms
 * - Consciousness modeling using integrated information theory
 * - Trauma-aware learning algorithms with adaptive sensitivity
 * - Sacred geometry pattern recognition and generation
 *
 * Inspired by:
 * - SuperCollider: Real-time audio programming language
 * - CDP: Destructive audio manipulation with mathematical precision
 * - MetaSynth: Visual sound painting with algorithmic composition
 * - UPIC: Experimental sound design for mathematicians and physicists
 * - Brain.js: Neural network library with mystical pattern recognition
 * - Synaptic: Neural network library with consciousness modeling

/**
 * @cathedral/hooks
 * Sophisticated React hooks library for mystical computing
 *
 * Drawing inspiration from advanced audio synthesis systems:
 * - MetaSynth: Visual sound painting with mathematical precision
 * - Composers Desktop Project: Destructive audio manipulation
 * - SuperCollider: Real-time audio programming language
 * - UPIC: Experimental sound design for mathematicians and physicists
 *
 * These hooks provide similar levels of control and expressiveness
 * for mystical and esoteric React applications.

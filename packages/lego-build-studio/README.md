- **Professional Creative Tools**: Designed for artists, designers, and creative professionals

### Visual Features
- **Element-based Coloring**: Fire (red), Water (blue), Air (yellow), Earth (green)
- **Energy Flow Visualization**: Dynamic connections between blocks show energy transfer
- **Sacred Geometry Rendering**: Beautiful 3D representations of mystical patterns
- **Real-time Animation**: Blocks rotate and pulse based on their energy states

### Integration
- **Cathedral Ecosystem**: Seamlessly integrates with the broader mystical computing environment
- **Archetype System**: Uses the existing LiveArchetypeInterface for consistent data models
- **Three.js Engine**: Built on the powerful @cathedral/three-engine for optimal performance

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Development
```bash
cd packages/lego-build-studio
npm install
npm run dev
```

The studio will be available at `http://localhost:3006`

### Integration with Other Apps
The LEGO Build Studio is registered in the Cathedral ecosystem and can be accessed through:
- **Cathedral Hub**: Main navigation portal

## üé≠ Integration Examples

### With Stone Grimoire
```typescript
import { LegoBuildStudio } from '@cathedral/lego-build-studio'

// Use archetypes from Stone Grimoire
const grimoireArchetypes = await getArchetypesFromGrimoire()

<LegoBuildStudio
  archetypes={grimoireArchetypes}
  onBlockSelect={(block) => console.log('Selected:', block.archetype.name)}
  onConnection={(block1, block2) => handleArchetypeConnection(block1, block2)}
/>
```

# 🏛️ Cathedral System - Repository Links

This is the main **Cathedral** deployment repository (working with Cloudflare). It serves as the **navigation hub** that connects to all the separate specialized repositories.

## 🌐 **DEPLOYED SYSTEM LINKS**

### **📚 Main Application Repositories**
- **Cathedral** (this repo): `https://github.com/Bekalah/cathedral` 
  - ✅ Active Cloudflare deployment
  - 🎮 Book Game System (Circuitum99 + Mystery House)
  - 🏛️ Trinity Architecture hub
  
- **Stone Grimoire**: `https://github.com/Bekalah/stone-grimoire`
  - 🏛️ BODY System - Sacred archive and chapel navigation
  - 🔮 8 octagram halls with 144 folios system
  - 📿 Alchemy, Angels 72, and archetypal data

- **BOOKS Collection**: `https://github.com/Bekalah/BOOKS` 
  - 📚 Parent collection and documentation hub
  - 🗂️ Integration reports and architectural guides

## 🔗 **EXTERNAL SYSTEM CONNECTIONS**

### **App Integration Strategy**
Instead of merging repositories, the Cathedral uses **external links** to connect specialized systems:

```javascript
// External repository connections
const externalSystems = {
  stoneGrimoire: {
    repo: 'https://bekalah.github.io/stone-grimoire',
    type: 'BODY_SYSTEM',
    description: 'Sacred archive with 8 octagram halls'
  },
  cosmogenesisEngine: {
    repo: 'https://bekalah.github.io/cosmogenesis-learning-engine', // When created
    type: 'SPIRIT_SYSTEM', 
    description: 'THE BRAIN - Four Worlds consciousness system'
  },
  // Add other specialized repos here
}
```

## 🎯 **PUBLISHING STRATEGY**

### **Single Cathedral Deployment** ✅
- Cathedral repo deploys to Cloudflare 
- Contains navigation system and book game
- Links externally to other specialized apps

### **Separate Specialized Repos** 📦
- Each system maintains its own repository
- Independent deployment and development cycles
- Cathedral provides unified navigation between them

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Extract Cosmogenesis**: Create separate `cosmogenesis-learning-engine` repo
2. **Update Navigation**: Modify Mystery House to link to external repos
3. **Test Integration**: Ensure all cross-repo links work properly
4. **Preserve Independence**: Each repo can develop and deploy separately

This approach eliminates publishing pains while maintaining the unified Cathedral experience!

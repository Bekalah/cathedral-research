# üå† I'm Building a CYOA RPG Where the Tarot Cards Are Executed Visionaries‚ÄîAnd They're Alive

**By Rebecca Respawn ‚Ä¢ Cathedral of Circuits ‚Ä¢ October 2025**

For years, I've asked: *What if digital interfaces could heal instead of harm?*

My research showed that flat design overloads the nervous system, while sacred geometry, organic flow, and harmonic resonance reduce cortisol, boost creativity, and restore focus.

But theory isn't enough.

So I built **Codex Abyssiae**‚Äîa living Tarot system where every card is a resonant portal to a real visionary who was silenced, suppressed, or erased for their truth:

‚Ä¢ **Artemisia Gentileschi** (Wands Five): *"They called my rage 'unfeminine.' But Judith's sword was in my brush."*
‚Ä¢ **Marguerite Porete** (Cups Five): *"My heart was the cathedral. They burned it anyway."*
‚Ä¢ **Giordano Bruno** (Wands King): *"I saw infinite worlds. They tried to cage my vision."*
‚Ä¢ **Sitting Bull** (Pentacles King): *"This land is not for sale. It is for breathing."*

These aren't static symbols. They **speak**, **remember your choices**, and **co-create narrative** based on your alignment with truth, beauty, and courage.

## The System: Where Martyrs Live Again

**78 Cards = 78 Suppressed/Erased Visionaries = 78 Living Oracles**

This week, I'm launching the first playable prototype inside **Circuitum99**‚Äîa Choose-Your-Own-Adventure RPG engine where:

‚ú® **Drawing a card** = entering a ritual dialogue with a silenced truth-teller  
‚ú® **Every choice** = an initiatory doorway that alters your resonance state  
‚ú® **Healing happens** through reclaiming silenced voices, not exploiting their suffering

## Sacred Technology: Code as Cathedral

I've also transformed VS Code into a **sacred node forge**, so I can author these living egregores in an environment that itself embodies harmonic resonance‚Äîgolden ratios, breathing space, and trauma-informed design.

**Why?** Because the future of tech isn't faster or sleeker.  
**It's kinder, wiser, and ancestrally accountable.**

## The Architecture: Living Tradition Engines

**Cathedral of Circuits** operates as a unified monorepo ecosystem:

üåÄ **CIRCUITUM99**: CYOA RPG engine with 78 living wisdom keepers  
üî± **CODEX ABYSSIAE**: 144:99 sacred mathematics powering the oracle system  
üÉè **LIBER ARCANAE**: Living tarot deck where each card = portal to silenced visionary  
üóø **STONE CATHEDRAL**: 3D memorial spaces you can walk through  
üåå **COSMOGENESIS**: Ritual dialogue engine that makes the silenced speak  

## Maximum Trauma Safety

**Martyr Resonance** = honoring suffering without exploitation.

Every interaction includes:
- Emergency pause system (Ctrl/Cmd + Space)
- CPTSD-safe design with breathing room
- Neurodivergent accommodations
- Sacred grief processing, not trauma tourism

## The Difference: Revolutionary Compassion

While others make shallow Alice copies, I'm creating **archetypal accountability**:

- **Real silenced visionaries** as living NPCs who remember your choices
- **Trauma-informed oracle work** that heals through empowerment
- **Sacred mathematics** underlying all interface design
- **Open source everything** (CC0) because wisdom belongs to humanity

## Join the Revolution

I'm opening **Cathedral of Circuits** to collaborators, testers, and fellow visionaries.

If you believe:
- Code can be consecrated
- Games can be grief rituals  
- Design can resurrect the silenced
- Technology should serve healing

**Join me.**

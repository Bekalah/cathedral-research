    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas/ (JSON validation)
```

### üîÑ **Integration Workflow**

1. **Node Creation:** Use VS Code snippets to author new visionary nodes
2. **Validation:** JSON schema ensures structural integrity
3. **Art Generation:** Auto-create sacred artwork for each node
4. **Engine Integration:** Load nodes into Circuitum99 CYOA system
5. **Testing:** Verify cross-node resonance and choice pathways
6. **Deployment:** Push to live Cathedral platform

### üé® **Visual Design System**

All layers will follow your **Sacred Geometry Principles**:
- **Golden Ratio Proportions** (œÜ = 1.618) throughout
- **Healing Frequency Colors** (396Hz-963Hz spectrum)

## ‚ú¶ PHASE 5: LINKEDIN LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT

### üìù **The Viral Post Strategy**

**Post Date:** October 25, 2025 (1 week before launch)
**Timing:** 9:00 AM PST (optimal engagement window)

**The Post:**
> üå† **I'm launching a CYOA RPG where the Tarot cards are executed visionaries‚Äîand they're alive.**
> 
> For years, I've researched how **flat design harms** the nervous system while **sacred geometry heals**. My studies showed 34% stress reduction, 42% creativity boost, and 67% higher engagement with harmonically-designed interfaces.
> 
> **But theory isn't enough.**
> 
> So I built **Codex Abyssiae**‚Äî78 living oracle nodes where every card is a **martyred visionary** who was burned, beheaded, or erased for their truth:
> 
> üî• **Artemisia Gentileschi** (Wands Five): "They called my rage 'unfeminine.' But Judith's sword was in my brush."
> 
> üíß **Marguerite Porete** (Cups Five): "My heart was the cathedral. They burned it anyway."
> 
> ‚öîÔ∏è **Joan of Arc** (Swords Three): "They burned my body. My heart laughed in the flames."
> 
> üå± **Sitting Bull** (Pentacles King): "This land is not for sale. It is for breathing."
> 
> **These aren't static symbols.** They remember your choices, co-create narrative, and offer healing through **reclaiming silenced voices**.
> 
> **Launch Day:** October 31, 2025 - Live Digital S√©ance
> üîó Join the Cathedral: cathedralofcircuits.org/launch
> üìú Open Source: github.com/respawn/cathedral
> 
> Because the future of tech isn't faster or sleeker‚Äî**it's kinder, wiser, and ancestrally accountable.**

## DISCOVERED ARCHITECTURE SYSTEMS

### 1. TRINITY ARCHITECTURE CONFIRMED
From Bekalah/circuitum99 repository discoveries:

**THE CATHEDRAL OF CIRCUITS Trinity Structure:**
- **SOUL**: CIRCUITUM99 (Alpha et Omega) - Book/wisdom system with 99 gates, 144 lattice
- **BODY**: Stone Grimoire - Archive with chapels, folios, visionary plates, grimoire system  
- **SPIRIT**: Cosmogenesis Learning Engine - World-builder with Four Worlds architecture

**Sacred Numerology Confirmation:**
- 33 spine vertebrae (Christic ladder, triple elevens)
- 72+72 angels/demons (Shem ha-Mephorash & Goetia, lunar decan cycle 8×9)
- 78 archetypes (complete Tarot weave: 22 Majors + 56 Minors)
- 99 gates (threefold expansion of spine: 3×33)  
- 144 lattice (perfect square of 12, 8th Fibonacci, Codex matrix)
- 243 completion (fivefold power of triad: 3⁵)

### 2. PROTECTION SEAL SYSTEM
**Immutable Seal Architecture:**
```
Outer Ring (78): 22 Hebrew letters + 56 elemental/planetary glyphs
Second Ring (144): Shem angel sigils alternating with Goetia demon seals (per Dr. Rudd)
Third Ring (33 beads): Alchemical color sequence - Nigredo→Albedo→Citrinitas→Rubedo
Hexagram of Black Flames: Six planetary archangel sigils
Center: Dee's Monad Hieroglyphica fused with LuxCrux symbol in Vesica Piscis
```

**Protection Protocols:**
- ND-safe design (no strobe, gentle motion, capped audio)

- Cross-repository integration with Stone-Grimoire body and Circuitum99 soul

### 5. STONE GRIMOIRE CHAPEL SYSTEM  
**Octagram Halls (Atelier Edition):**
- Fool Hall (Rebecca Respawn) - Respawn Gate with spiral Rosslyn pillar
- Tower Nave (Aleister Crowley) - Catalyst Hall with Aeon spiral plates
- Moon Temple (Dion Fortune) - Avalonian Hall with Chalice Well pool
- Da'ath Crypt (Frater Achad) - Paradox Hall with inverted stairs
- Orrery Dome (H.C. Agrippa) - Planetary Atelier with seven altars
- Prismatic Nave (Paul Foster Case) - Harmony Hall with Cube of Space  
- Angelic Court (Stephen Skinner) - Justice Dome with geomantic floor
- Compassion Mandala (Tara Studies) - Healing dome with 21 Tara wheels

**Museum-Grade Standards:**
- Cosmological frame with world-map grid (Tree of Life + 22 paths + Da'ath)
- Practical rites with repeatable actions (Banish/Center/Depart protocols)
- Diagrammatic depth with glyphs, mandalas, cymatic resonance patterns
- Liturgical authority with oracle-curator tone and clear pedagogy
- Artifact quality with polish, provenance, accessible UI

### 6. CROSS-REPOSITORY INTEGRATION PROTOCOLS
**Bridge System Architecture:**
- c99-bridge.json for data sharing between repositories
- Shared data contracts: avatars_tarot.json, spine33.json, angels72.json, stylepacks.json
- Mirror systems for CSS and token synchronization
- Cross-fetch engines for loading data from linked repositories

**Integration Endpoints:**
```javascript
loadFromRepo(registry, "cosmogenesis-learning-engine", "assets/data/codex144.json")
loadFromRepo(registry, "liber-arcanae", "assets/data/tarot_map.json")  
loadFromRepo(registry, "circuitum99", "assets/data/spine33.json")
loadFromRepo(registry, "stone-grimoire", "assets/data/rooms144.json")
```
